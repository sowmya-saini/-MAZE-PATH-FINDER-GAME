PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The project aims to develop a maze-solving system where the player navigates from the starting point ('S') to the target ('T') within a grid while facing the challenge of limited chances. 
The system will allow the player to make moves in up, down, left, and right directions along walkable tiles ('.') while avoiding walls ('#'). 
The player will have three chances to reach the target, failing which the game ends.

Develop an algorithm to efficiently find the minimum number of moves required to solve mazes.
Optimize the algorithm for performance, considering large maze sizes.

Implement a mechanism to track and manage the player's chances during gameplay.
Allow the player to make only three attempts to reach the target position 'T'.

USED:
Programming Language: Python 
Libraries/Frameworks: Pygame (for UI)
Development Tools: IDEs (Visual Studio Code)
